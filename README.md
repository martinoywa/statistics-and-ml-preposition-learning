> .ipynb, representing jupyter notebooks 

> .pk (pickle files), representing any file generated from the jupyter notebooks.

> .csv, containing the testData + results.

File names are in accordace to exactly what they are for such that EnglishL1-Cleaning.ipynp is where data cleaning for English Sentences was done, EnglishL1-Vector-Testing, is where the word embeddings for English sentences was done, e.t.c.

Each notebooks has some comments as to what exactly is being done.
